 There ought to be a poem,<br>
	 about things. <br> 
	Considering things are so much of what we are. <br>
	It ought to say <br>
	 they exist and then don't <br>
	and chatter while we wait.<br>
	 We could confuse ourselves with things <br>
	 and matters not of which we care, <br>
	 as if love and yearning <br>
	 hold no meaning <br>
	 until their very essence <br>
	 becomes protocol. <br>
	 And alone, we are reminded all too well<br>
	  that things are what we are.
